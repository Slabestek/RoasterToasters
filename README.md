# Lectures en Lesroosters
'Lectures and Lesroosters' is our case, in which we generate an optimal schedule by using 
algorithms. In this project we created a data structure with python classes, where the data that was 
delivered to us is read. This data is then passed on to our algorithm which we use in different 
ways to optimize a schedule.

# Vereisten
The code is written in Python 3.6.3 and uses two libraries, Flask and Jinja2, which can be found in
'requirements.txt'. These libraries can be installed using ```pip install```.

# Uitvoeren van tests
Tests can be run in main.py. Different algorithms can be called here. 
In main.py the schedule can be visualized by running: 
'''FLASK_APP=test.py flask run'''

# RoasterToasters
Toasting and roasting, a case by Bas, Boudewijn & Esmee.
